Data Structure:

1. singlyLinkedList.cpp-

singlyLinkedList.cpp is a menu-driven Cplusplus code that creates a singly linked list, displays it, inserts given argument to front, at a specific position and at the last, deletes the node from beginning, at a specific position and at the last. The code is heavily commented for readability and variable names are highly friendly. The code is written on the object oriented programming paradigm.

2. insertingInSortedLinkedList.cpp-

insertingInSortedLinkedList.cpp is a class-based CPlusPlus code that accepts a SORTED (ascending order) singly linked list and then inserts a new node to the existing list without messing up the sorted order.

3. checkIfListIsSorted.cpp-

checkIfListIsSorted.cpp is a bunch of code that checks if the singly linked list is sorted (ascending order) or not and displays the result with appropriate message.

4. removeDuplicateNode.cpp-

removeDuplicateNode.cpp removes duplicate nodes from a sorted (ascending order) singly linked list.

5. reverseList.cpp-

reverseList.cpp is code which reverses the singly linked list by reversing the link of the nodes in both ways: iterative way and recursive way.

6. concatenateList.cpp-

concatenateList.cpp is code which accepts two singly linked list and concatenates the second linked list to the end of first linked list without using any extra space.

7. checkForLoop.cpp- 

checkForLoop.cpp checks whether a singly linked list has loop or not. Loop means that the end pointer of a linked list is not NULL and points to some node.

8. mergingTwoLists.cpp-

mergingTwoLists.cpp merges two sorted singly linked list without using any extra space (does it in O(1) space). Merging is done by the help of a dummy head!

9. moreCodeCommingSoon.cpp-

More code and files will be pushed as I code.


P.S : Pull requests will be highly appreciated if you find a bug !!
