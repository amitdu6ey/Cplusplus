Data Structure:


************ Linked List: ************


---------- Singly Linked List: ------------

1. singlyLinkedList.cpp-
singlyLinkedList.cpp is a menu-driven Cplusplus code that creates a singly linked list, displays it, inserts given argument to front, at a specific position and at the last, deletes the node from beginning, at a specific position and at the last. The code is heavily commented for readability and variable names are highly friendly. The code is written on the object oriented programming paradigm.

2. insertingInSortedLinkedList.cpp-
insertingInSortedLinkedList.cpp is a class-based CPlusPlus code that accepts a SORTED (ascending order) singly linked list and then inserts a new node to the existing list without messing up the sorted order.

3. checkIfListIsSorted.cpp-
checkIfListIsSorted.cpp is a bunch of code that checks if the singly linked list is sorted (ascending order) or not and displays the result with appropriate message.

4. removeDuplicateNode.cpp-
removeDuplicateNode.cpp removes duplicate nodes from a sorted (ascending order) singly linked list.

5. reverseList.cpp-
reverseList.cpp is code which reverses the singly linked list by reversing the link of the nodes in both ways: iterative way and recursive way.

6. concatenateList.cpp-
concatenateList.cpp is code which accepts two singly linked list and concatenates the second linked list to the end of first linked list without using any extra space.

7. checkForLoop.cpp-
checkForLoop.cpp checks whether a singly linked list has loop or not. Loop means that the end pointer of a linked list is not NULL and points to some node.

8. mergingTwoLists.cpp-
mergingTwoLists.cpp merges two sorted singly linked list without using any extra space (does it in O(1) space). Merging is done by the help of a dummy head!

------------ Circular Linked List --------------

9. createAndDisplayCLL.cpp-
This code creates a circular linked list and displays it to the user. (nothing fancy!)

10. insertingInCLL.cpp-
insertingInCLL.cpp is code which inserts a node to all the posible places in the linked list. Inserting the node in the beginning, to the end and to the specific position as specified by the user.
One of the most challenging code I've written because maintaining the head in CLL is a huge pain in the a$$.

11. deletingInCLL.cpp- 
deletingInCLL.cpp enables us to delete any node from the Circular Linked List. From the beginnig, from any specified position and from the end of the list.
Again, this code was also challenging as I had to maintain the head while deleting.

------------ Doubly Linked List -------------

12. createAndDisplayDLL.cpp-
This Code creates a Doubly Linked List and displays it to the user.

13. insertionInDLL.cpp-
This code creates a Doubly Linked List, displays it and also lets user to insert a element at any place in the linked list. At the Beginning, at the end & at any position that user wants.

14. deletionInDLL.cpp-
This lets user to delete node from the given Doubly Linked List and the deletion can be done at the head, at the tail/end node or at any position given by the user.

15. reverseDLL.cpp-
This code accepts integer values to the doubly linked list and then reverses it and displays the resultant reverse list. 


************ Stack *************


16. implementStackWithArray.cpp-
This code shows the implementation of stack data structure with array and along with that all the operations on stack ADT has been performed like push(data), pop() and even peek().

17. implementStackWithLinkedList.cpp-
This object-oriented code shows the implementation of stack data structure with singly linked list and all the operations on stack ADT has been performed like push(data), pop() and even peek().

18. parenthesisMatching.cpp-
It's a code which uses stack to validate parenthesis in an expression, i.e. checks if the parenthesis of an expression is valid.

19. evaluatePostfixExpression.cpp-
This code takes postfix expression as string from the user and then implements and evaluate it using the concept of stack and displays it to user in linear time complexity.


************ Queue: **************


20. implementQueueWithArray.cpp- 
I implemented queue data structure (FIFO) with Array data structure in this code and functionality like enqueue and dequeue is enabled in it. It is also a menu driven program and you can have fun with it.

21. implementQueueWithLinkedList.cpp-
I Implemented Queue data structure using a singly linked list and added the enqueue and dequeue functionality into a menu driven paradigm.

22. implementingCircularQueue.cpp-
I implemented Circular Queue using the concept of rotating pointers to improve the utilization of space in array implementation of a queue.

23. queueUsingTwoStacks.cpp-
I Implemented a Queue data structure (FIFO) using two Stacks (LIFO) using a functions-based menu-driven paradigm codebase.
